# Minimal E-Commerce App

Here, I built the UI for an E-Commerce App with redundant images of a single laptop. It's a scalable application.

## 1. Getting Started

I have used the Flutter(Dart) programming language on Android Studio to build this app. A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.



## 2. Screens

This section walks you through the functionality of this application:

The Welcome Screen:

</p>

## 3. Navigation

After pressing start, you are greeted by the home screen which is the shop showing the trending sales at first followeed by other items. To help with navigation there's the Google nav Bar on the bottom. There's also a drawer for logging out and other useful options.
